# PathNavigator

## Background and Overview
PathNavigator is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer that uses BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## Functionality and MVPs
Users will be able to:
  - Select a pathfinding algorithm
  - Select the speed of the algorithm
  - Draw or randomly generate walls on the graph around a root and target node
  - Move the start and target nodes anywhere on the graph
